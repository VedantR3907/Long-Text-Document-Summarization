Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer\\nand BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends\\nbeyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be\\nframed as a powerful general problem solver.\\n\\n# Agent System Overview#\\n\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain,\\ncomplemented by several key components:\\n\\n  * **Planning**\\n    * Subgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\n    * Reflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n  * **Memory**\\n    * Short-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\n    * Long-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n  * **Tool use**\\n    * The agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\n# Component One: Planning#\\n\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what\\nthey are and plan ahead.\\n\\n## Task Decomposition#\\n\\n**Chain of thought** (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting\\ntechnique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is\\ninstructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to\\ndecompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks\\ninto multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the\\nmodel’s thinking process.\\n\\n**Tree of Thoughts** (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple\\nreasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into\\nmultiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a\\ntree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS\\n(depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt)\\nor majority vote.\\n\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like `\"Steps\\nfor XYZ.\\\\n1.\"`, `\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\"`, (2) by using\\ntask-specific instructions; e.g. `\"Write a story outline.\"` for writing a\\nnovel, or (3) with human inputs.\\n\\nAnother quite distinct approach, **LLM+P** (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying\\non an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach\\nutilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate\\ninterface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1)\\ntranslates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical\\nplanner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and\\nfinally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially,\\nthe planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability\\nof domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain\\nrobotic setups but not in many other domains.\\n\\n## Self-Reflection#'),\n",
       "  Document(metadata={'source': './documents/text2.txt'}, page_content='Self-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve\\niteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous\\nmistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error\\nare inevitable.\\n\\n**ReAct** (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by\\nextending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete\\nactions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the\\nenvironment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to\\ngenerate reasoning traces in natural language.\\n\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think,\\nroughly formatted as:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    Thought: ...\\n    Action: ...\\n    Observation: ...\\n    ...

After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and\\noptionally may _decide to reset_ the environment to start a new trial\\ndepending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn &\\nLabash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or\\ncontains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to\\ntrajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as\\nencountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same\\nobservation in the environment.\\n\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each\\nexample is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future\\nchanges in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working\\nmemory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more\\ncommon failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn &\\nLabash, 2023)\\n\\n**Chain of Hindsight** (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve\\non its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past\\noutputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of\\n$D_h = \\\\\\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each\\n$y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is\\nthe corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback\\ntuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The\\nprocess is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of\\n$\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq\\nn$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the\\nsequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output\\nbased on the feedback sequence.

Considering\\nthat an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode\\nthe agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and\\nfeeds that into the model.

The history data is generated by a set of source\\npolicies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each\\nRL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is\\nused for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\n\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be\\nshort enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of\\n2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm.\\nThe emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\n\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation,\\nbehavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source\\npolicy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan\\net al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates\\nin-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using\\noffline RL and learns much faster than other baselines.

I’ve learned a\\nlot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations\\nwith ChatGPT.)\\n\\n## Types of Memory#\\n\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and\\nlater retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n  1. **Sensory Memory** : This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n  2. **Short-Term Memory** (STM) or **Working Memory** : It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n  3. **Long-Term Memory** (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:'),\n",
       "  Document(metadata={'source': './documents/text2.txt'}, page_content='* Explicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\n     * Implicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\n  * Sensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\n  * Short-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\n  * Long-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\n## Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\n\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span. A\\nstandard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into\\na vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search\\n(MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the _approximate\\nnearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b_ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest\\nneighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\n\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\n  * **LSH** (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a _hashing_ function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\n  * **ANNOY** (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are _random projection trees_ , a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\n  * **HNSW** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\n  * **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist _clustering_ of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\n  * **ScaNN** (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is _anisotropic vector quantization_. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\nFig. 9.

A MRKL\\nsystem is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the\\ngeneral-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable\\nexpert module.

       "  Document(metadata={'source': './documents/text2.txt'}, page_content=\"Instruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe\\nthe process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{\\nUser Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model\\nAssignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the\\nuser's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and\\nshow your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first\\nperson. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the\\ncomplete file path.\\n\\n**(4) Response generation** : LLM receives the execution results and provides\\nsummarized results to users.\\n\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve:\\n(1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and\\ninteractions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long\\ncontext window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability\\nimprovement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\n\\n**API-Bank** (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of\\ntool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-\\naugmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API\\ncalls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines,\\ncalculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health\\ndata management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a\\nlarge number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the\\nright API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a\\ncall.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source:\\nLi et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each\\nstep we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\n  1. Whether an API call is needed.\\n  2. Identify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\n  3. Response based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\n  * Level-1 evaluates the ability to _call the API_. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\n  * Level-2 examines the ability to _retrieve the API_. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\n  * Level-3 assesses the ability to _plan API beyond retrieve and call_. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\n# Case Studies#\\n\\n## Scientific Discovery Agent#\\n\\n**ChemCrow** (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is\\naugmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic\\nsynthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in\\nLangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and\\ncombines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\n  * The LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\n  * It is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - `Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation`.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded\\nthat GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with\\nexperts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the\\nsolutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This\\nindicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance\\non domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs\\nnot knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task\\nresults.\"),\n",

This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read\\ndocumentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage\\nother LLMs.\\n\\nFor example, when requested to `\"develop a novel anticancer drug\"`, the model\\ncame up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\n  1. inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\n  2. selected a target;\\n  3. requested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\n  4. Once the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons.\\nThey developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents\\nand asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were\\naccepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult\\ndocumentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among\\nthese 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected\\nbased on prompt only.\\n\\n## Generative Agents Simulation#\\n\\n**Generative Agents** (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25\\nvirtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and\\ninteracting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents\\ncreate believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\n\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and\\nreflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past\\nexperience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\n  * **Memory** stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language. \\n    * Each element is an _observation_ , an event directly provided by the agent. \\\\- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n  * **Retrieval** model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance. \\n    * Recency: recent events have higher scores\\n    * Importance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\n    * Relevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n  * **Reflection** mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are _higher-level summaries of past events_ (<\\\\- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above) \\n    * Prompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n  * **Planning & Reacting**: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions \\n    * Planning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\n    * Prompt template: `{Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)`\\n    * Relationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\n    * Environment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information\\ndiffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation\\ntopic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many\\nothers).\\n\\n## Proof-of-Concept Examples#\\n\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up\\nautonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n  * **Challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition** : Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n  * **Reliability of natural language interface** : Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction).

It includes a prompt template with explicit steps for thinking, acting, and observing.\\n- **Reflexion**: A framework that equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities. It includes a heuristic function to determine when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination, and allows the agent to reset the environment and start a new trial.\\n- **Chain of Hindsight (CoH)**: Encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. The model is finetuned to predict the final output in the sequence, conditioned on the sequence prefix.\\n\\nThese frameworks are evaluated on various tasks, such as knowledge-intensive tasks (HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (AlfWorld Env, WebShop).
